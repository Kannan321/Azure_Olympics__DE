# Olympics Data Engineering Project on Azure

Welcome to the Olympics Data Engineering project powered by Azure! This repository demonstrates the effective utilization of various Azure services for data ingestion, storage, transformation, and analysis of Olympics-related data. We've harnessed the capabilities of Azure to achieve these objectives:

## Introduction to Tools

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Azure Data Factory serves as the core for data ingestion. This service empowers us to seamlessly collect data from diverse sources and transport it to desired destinations. Within this project, ADF efficiently pulls in Olympics data from external sources.

- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:** The heart of data storage lies in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Offering a secure and scalable platform, this service effectively accommodates vast data volumes. This solution ensures robust data management, accessibility, and analysis capabilities.

- **Azure Databricks:** Data transformation is a breeze with Azure Databricks and PySpark. This collaborative environment brings data engineers and data scientists together, enabling them to collaboratively work on significant data projects. We leverage PySpark in this project to cleanse, reshape, and process raw Olympics data into an actionable format.

- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Extracting insights from transformed data is made possible by Azure Synapse Analytics. This service facilitates the execution of SQL queries on the data warehouse, enabling the extraction of valuable insights. Here, we uncover trends, patterns, and pivotal information related to the Olympics data.

## Project Overview

To dive into the project, follow these key steps:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Leveraging Azure Data Factory, configure data ingestion from your selected data sources. Define the data movement and transformations required to bring Olympics data into the Azure ecosystem.

2. **Data Storage:** Store ingested data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Organize data with appropriate folder structures and set permissions to ensure data security and organization.

3. **Data Transformation:** Employ Azure Databricks with PySpark for data transformation. Implement data cleansing, preprocessing, and reshaping operations to prepare data for analysis.

4. **Data Analytics:** Harness the power of Azure Synapse Analytics to gain meaningful insights. Execute SQL queries on the data warehouse to unveil trends, statistics, and patterns inherent in the Olympics data.
